# Light-IT Frontend Challenge "Patient Data Management"

## By Anonymous Hobbit
This is a simple patient data management application. It allows you to add, edit, and delete patients. The data comes from [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/).

It includes custom UI components like:
- Button
- Input (Text, Date, Textarea)
- Select
- Modal
- Drawer

Except for some minor exceptions, the UI is built using vanilla TailwindCSS classes.
